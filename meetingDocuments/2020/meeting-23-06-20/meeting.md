## Agenda

1. Planning the 1st event
2. Deciding rough annual plan for events and targets
3. CompSoc email names
4. Organising coming EGM (3rd July)

## Minutes
1. The committe decided that for the first event we will possibly collaborate with GameSoc. We want to focus on fun and entertainment as opposed to development of skills in the first month. The first event could be the freshers Game night where we would have segments of showcases, fun challenges etc. The first event should be possible to organize in the event that it's going to be held online, and we are going to keep that in mind. Some Ideas:

    - Game Showcases (either from our developers or some external party)

    - Scratch game design challenge (make a game/animation in X minutes ) 

    - Discussion on game tropes

2. 
    - We have decided to hold bi-weekly and monthly regular events where once a month we'd require at least one speaker to give a talk on related topics, and once a month require a hands-on workshop to be held. Exact scheduling is to be set in the future in a way that doesn't clash with CompSoc events. 

    - We have set a target for active members this year of 15 at the very least

    - We are aiming to hold 3 events in welcome week/month

    - We are going to be pushing polls to the incoming freshers and beginning to market to them before welcome week begins.

    - We are going to reinforce the idea that we are looking to receive help from the members as much as possible in many ways, and that everyone can participate in our showcases/talks

    - First speakers will be people that already collaborated with us before so that we have time to gather new speakers

    - We won't be aiming to gather any sponsors this year since member numbers are low (although this could change)
  
3. we decided to have one main email to avoid confusion, under: GameDevSig@comp-soc.com, and have our individual emails be linked to that main email

4. The coming EGM will be held online as a google form vote on the matter of transferring to a SIG, we will be posting more information to our members soon
